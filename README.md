# The Burger Handler
An ORM paradigm for managing burger possesion and consumption.

# Abstract

This is a simple, virtual burger eating application.  Users can add and devoure burgers to and from a stack that is tracked in a database. When a burger is devoured, it's state is changed and remains in the DB as having been eaten.   The website is built on an object relational framework with layers seperating views, controllers and models.
